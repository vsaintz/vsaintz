I’m Roland, a software developer and writer.

I like building things that actually get used. Coding gave me more ways to turn ideas into tools and projects that make life a bit easier. Most of what I make starts with a problem I bumped into myself. If others find it useful, that’s always nice, but it isn’t the main driver.

Lately I’ve been spending more time with machine learning and data work. Outside of code, I draw and do some graphic design, which slows things down and uses a different part of my brain. I also write, mostly on whatever I’m curious about at the moment. It helps me think things through and see what actually matters to me.
